            Hello! I enjoy doing front end projects but I also have some back
            end skills. My biggest strengths come about finding solutions that
            the final user will see. Front end is great because I get the
            opportunity to solve both logic and design problems, which makes
            motives me.

            I got started in software development in 2020, learning by myself
            with free platforms on the internet; then, when I had the chance, I
            joined college. Now I have one year left to graduate ðŸ˜Š
