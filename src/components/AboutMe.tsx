            Hello! I enjoy doing front end projects but I also have some back
            end skills. My biggest strengths come about finding solutions that
            the final user will see. Front end is great because I get the
            opportunity to solve both logic and design problems, which motivates me.
          </p>
          <p>
            I got started in software development in 2020, learning by myself
            with free platforms on the internet; I started working at <a target="_blank" href="https://widexcorp.ca/">Widexcorp c.a.</a>
            as FrontEnd developer and since 2022 I work for  <a target="_blank" href="https://ar.nttdata.com/about-us">NTT DATA</a> as Fullstak developer. 
            Now I have one year left to graduate ðŸ˜Š This website is owned and operated by Andrea BriceÃ±o.
